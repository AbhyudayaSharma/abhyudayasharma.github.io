I'm leaving my job at Dell and I need to return the laptop they gave me. Time for some fun! This is what their IT
department will see when they switch that laptop back on:

<video src='/a-gift-for-dell-it.m4v' autoPlay={false} controls={true} height='400'
       style={{display: 'block', margin: 'auto'}}/>

I can only imagine an IT person helplessly trying to stop it while it plays on full volume.

This is powered by [mpv](https://mpv.io/) and [Sway](https://mpv.io/) on Arch Linux. All key bindings have been disabled
in the Sway config. mpv's keyboard controls are disabled, the video will loop forever, and the UI controls won't ever
show. This will be UNSTOPPABLE!*

## Moar Details

Essentially, this is the sway config:

```bash
exec /bin/mpv /home/dell/video.mp4 --hwdec=auto --vo=gpu --volume=130 --loop --no-input-default-bindings --script--opts=osc-visibility=never --fullscreen
```

`agetty(8)` is [configured](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Getty#Automatic_login_to_virtual_console) to automatically
log into a non-root user and starts `bash` which executes the commands in `~/.bash_profile`.

```bash
sleep 5

if [ -z $DISPLAY ] && [ "$(tty)" = "/dev/tty1" ]; then
  exec sway
fi
```

`sleep 5` is necessary otherwise mpv would start playing the video without sound. I did try to wait for `sound.target`
and for `/dev/snd/` to be populated but that didn't help. I did not want to spend a lot of time on this so I used the
__best__ tool to solve concurrency issues, `sleep`.
