title: Micro-benchmarking Framework for Jenkins Plugins
description: 'I have been working on improving the performance of the Role Strategy Plugin as a part of my Google
  Summer of Code project. Since there was no existing way to measure performance on Jenkins Plugins, my work for
  the first phase of the project was to create a framework for running benchmarks in Jenkins plugins.'
